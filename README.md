I uploaded the initial state of the program.  
Still getting used to github so changes are expected.  
I'll continue to utilize this repo throughout the project and provide updates in this readme.  
Currently, it's just the core files. It will need an environment that contains pygame in order to run.  
I can include the virtual environment that I use if you want, but it looks like that's bad practice here.  

I'll try to figure out how to create a requirements file at some point.  
Expect a bulk of the improvements to occur during spring break.

March 4th  
Added README.md to project (not just GitHub)  
fixed typo  
added colors list  
Tried working with classes...  
    It's slow progress  
Spent some time staring at the code...  
    Inspiration isn't my friend right tonight.  

March 6th  
Worked on UML diagrams  
Stared a lot mindlessly  
Worked on the car and thing classes  
Decided to scrap the data class and found I could just have the data declared up top to do what I wanted.  
Learned that two spaces at the end of a line in .md creates a new line!  
Decided that I'm going to rewrite a new version of the script instead of trying to re-engineer the original.
