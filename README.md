Thank you for checking out my python game.  
It's based on the tutorial created by Sentdex.  
> You can find his tutorial at https://pythonprogramming.net/pygame-python-3-part-1-intro/  

You can use either 'a' & 'd' or arrow keys to move.

The goal of the game is to see how many blocks you can pass within 3 lives.  
You will need a python interpreter as well as pygame.  

I hope you enjoy!!!

Data found in ClassObjects.py is game logic  
whereas the data found in ARaceyDrive.py relates to flow and display.

Some fun values to play with
