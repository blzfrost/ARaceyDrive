Thank you for checking out my python game.  
It's based on the tutorial created by Sentdex.  
> You can find his tutorial at https://pythonprogramming.net/pygame-python-3-part-1-intro/  

You can use either 'a' & 'd' or arrow keys to move.

The goal of the game is to see how many blocks you can pass within 3 lives.  
You will need a python interpreter as well as pygame.  

I hope you enjoy!!!

----------------

Data found in ClassObjects.py is game logic  
whereas the data found in ARaceyDrive.py relates to flow and display.

Some fun values in ClassObjects that's fun to play with:  
display_height/display_width (Your road, your rules)  
start2/start3 (The scores needed for more things)  
starting_score (It's not cheating, it's looking ahead!)  
FPS (clock speed modifier)  
global_multi (thing and car speed multi)  
lives (more is better, right?!?!)
