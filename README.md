On 02/15/21 I uploaded the initial state of the program. Still getting used to github so changes are expected. 
I'll continue to utilize this repo throughout the project and provide updates in this readme. 
Currently, it's just the core files. It will need an environment that contains pygame in order to run. 
I can include the virtual environment that I use if you want, but it looks like that's bad practice here.


I'll try to figure out how to create a requirements file at some point. 
Expect a bulk of the improvements to occur during spring break.
